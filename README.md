## Introduction:
This repository is dedicated to the study and implementation of branch prediction algorithms in modern computer processors, with a particular focus on the TAGE predictor. It serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring various branch prediction techniques and their effectiveness.

## Contents:
- BranchPrediction.pdf: A detailed report on branch prediction methods, including TAGE, Smith, Bimodal, Hybrid, and Gshare predictors.
- Java Files:
    - Counter.java
    - sim.java
    - TageEntry.java
    - TageTable.java 
- These Java files collectively implement the branch prediction algorithms discussed in the report.

## Algorithm Details:
- The repository covers several branch prediction algorithms:

    - TAGE (Tagged Geometric History Length) Predictor
    - Smith Predictor
    - Bimodal Predictor
    - Hybrid Predictor
    - Gshare Predictor
- The TAGE predictor's unique approach to branch prediction is highlighted, along with comparisons to traditional methods.

## Implementation:
- The Java implementation includes a simulator for evaluating the performance of each predictor. The code is structured across multiple files, each handling different aspects of the simulation.

## Results and Analysis:
- The report discusses the accuracy and efficiency of the TAGE predictor compared to traditional methods, demonstrating its superiority in certain scenarios.

## Usage Instructions:
- To use the simulation, clone the repository and run the Java files. The BranchPrediction.pdf provides detailed explanations and results for reference.

## Requirements:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
